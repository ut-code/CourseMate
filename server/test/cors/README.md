# CORS test

# how to run test

0. cd into test/cors
1. run `./test.sh`. this compiles ts to js and runs all the servers necessary.
2. access localhost:8080 and check all buttons work.
3. access localhost:12345 and check all buttons don't work.
4. check terminal afterward and make sure no requests from localhost:12345 made it.
